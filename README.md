# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide that goes over the four topics I have learned during my prework for the web development boot camp. I have programmed it to help me study the fundamentals of web development and practice new coding tools. I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript while coding it.

To help the user study web development, this website has 4 sections containing basic notes about the 4 tools used to create it: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can see the JavaScript running by using CTRL+Shift+I to open DevTools and go into the console. There you will see my JavaScript listing out all of the topics and randomly generating a topic to study first for those who are indecisive, like myself.
